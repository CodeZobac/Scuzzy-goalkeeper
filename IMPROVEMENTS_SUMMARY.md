# Guest User Experience Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mapbox Map Rendering Issue ✅

**Problem**: The mapbox map was not rendering properly because the app was using `String.fromEnvironment` instead of loading from the `.env` file.

**Solution**:

- Modified `lib/src/core/config/app_config.dart` to use `dotenv.env['MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN']` instead of `String.fromEnvironment`
- This ensures the Mapbox token is properly loaded from the `.env` file

### 2. Tilted Profile Button ✅

**Problem**: The guest profile screen had a rotation animation on the register button that made it look tilted and unprofessional.

**Solution**:

- Removed the `Transform.rotate` animation from the register button in `lib/src/features/user_profile/presentation/screens/guest_profile_screen.dart`
- Kept the scale animation for a smooth appearance effect
- Button now appears normally without any tilt

### 3. Difficult Login for Existing Users ✅

**Problem**: Users with existing accounts had no easy way to log in from the guest app interface.

**Solutions Implemented**:

- **Added "Já tenho conta" (I already have an account) button** to the guest profile screen alongside the register button
- **Added floating login button** in the top-right corner of all screens for guest users
- Both buttons navigate to the sign-in screen (`/signin`)

### 4. Non-functional Filter Button ✅

**Problem**: The filter button in the announcements screen had TODO comments and no actual functionality.

**Solution**:

- Implemented complete filter functionality with the following options:
  - All Announcements (default)
  - Today (shows only today's games)
  - This Week (shows games from current week)
  - Free Games (shows games with no cost)
  - Paid Games (shows games with a price)
- Filter state is properly managed and persists during the session
- Filter selection is visually indicated with radio buttons

### 5. Enhanced Mock Data ✅

**Problem**: Limited mock data in the database made the map and app less interesting for testing.

**Solution**:

- Added 8 new goalkeeper users with realistic Portuguese names, cities, and clubs
- Added 8 new football fields across different Portuguese cities (Lisboa, Porto, Coimbra, Braga, Aveiro, Leiria)
- All new data includes proper coordinates, descriptions, and field specifications

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality

- Removed unused rotation animation variables and logic
- Improved button layout and spacing in guest profile screen
- Added proper state management for filter functionality
- Enhanced user experience with visual feedback

### User Experience

- Guest users now have clear paths to both register and login
- Floating login button provides consistent access across all screens
- Filter functionality makes it easier to find relevant announcements
- More realistic data makes the app feel more complete and professional

### Navigation Flow

- Seamless transition from guest mode to authenticated mode
- Proper handling of intended destinations after login/registration
- Consistent UI patterns across guest and authenticated experiences
