# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the visual experience of the Goalkeeper app by properly integrating SVG assets throughout the application and significantly enhancing the UX/UI of authentication pages. The current auth pages lack the beautiful UI/UX standards found in the rest of the application, and SVG icons are not rendering properly on web. The goal is to create an outstanding user experience that matches the app's overall design quality while ensuring proper SVG rendering across all platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the authentication pages, I want to see a beautiful and consistent visual design that matches the rest of the app, so that I have confidence in the application's quality and professionalism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the sign-in or sign-up pages THEN the auth-header.svg SHALL render properly at the top of the page
2. WHEN a user interacts with auth pages THEN the visual design SHALL be consistent with the app's overall design language
3. WHEN a user views auth pages on web THEN all SVG elements SHALL render without errors or fallbacks
4. WHEN a user navigates between auth pages THEN smooth animations SHALL provide visual continuity
5. IF the auth-header.svg fails to load THEN a graceful fallback SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the map, I want to see intuitive and visually appealing icons that clearly represent different elements (football fields, players, goalkeepers), so that I can quickly understand the map information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views football fields on the map THEN the icons8-football-field.svg SHALL be used as the field marker
2. WHEN a user views player locations on the map THEN the icons8-football.svg SHALL be used as the player marker
3. WHEN a user views goalkeeper locations on the map THEN the icons8-goalkeeper-o-mais-baddy.svg SHALL be used as the goalkeeper marker
4. WHEN a user interacts with map markers THEN the SVG icons SHALL scale and animate smoothly
5. WHEN SVG icons are displayed on the map THEN they SHALL maintain crisp quality at all zoom levels

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust SVG handling system that works consistently across web and mobile platforms, so that visual assets render properly regardless of the deployment target.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs on web THEN all SVG assets SHALL render without console errors
2. WHEN the app runs on mobile platforms THEN SVG assets SHALL render with the same quality as web
3. WHEN SVG assets fail to load THEN appropriate fallback mechanisms SHALL be triggered
4. WHEN SVG assets are cached THEN subsequent loads SHALL be faster and more efficient
5. IF an SVG asset is missing THEN the app SHALL continue to function with a default icon

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the authentication flow, I want responsive and accessible UI components that work well on different screen sizes, so that I can easily complete authentication tasks on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses auth pages on mobile THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately to smaller screens
2. WHEN a user accesses auth pages on tablet THEN the layout SHALL utilize the available space effectively
3. WHEN a user accesses auth pages on desktop THEN the layout SHALL be centered and visually balanced
4. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible
5. WHEN a user uses screen readers THEN all SVG elements SHALL have appropriate accessibility labels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual feedback and micro-interactions throughout the authentication process, so that the interface feels polished and responsive to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over interactive elements THEN subtle visual feedback SHALL be provided
2. WHEN a user clicks buttons or links THEN appropriate loading states SHALL be shown
3. WHEN form validation occurs THEN error states SHALL be visually clear and helpful
4. WHEN a user successfully completes an action THEN positive feedback SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN transitions occur between auth states THEN smooth animations SHALL guide the user experience
