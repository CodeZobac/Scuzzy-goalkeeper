# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Notifications System feature provides targeted notifications for key user interactions in the goalkeeper finder app. This system will deliver specific notifications to goalkeepers when they are contracted for games and to players/teams when their announcements reach full capacity. The feature builds upon the existing notification infrastructure while adding new notification types and enhanced UI components that match the announcements and maps page styling.
