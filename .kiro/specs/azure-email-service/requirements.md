# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a secure Azure-based email service to replace Supabase's email service limitations. The system will handle email confirmation and password reset functionality using existing HTML templates, with secure time-limited authentication codes that integrate with Supabase Auth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to receive an email confirmation when I sign up, so that I can verify my email address and activate my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the signup process THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email using the Azure email service
2. WHEN the confirmation email is sent THEN the system SHALL include a secure authentication code that is valid for 5 minutes
3. WHEN the user clicks the confirmation button in the email THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the appropriate page with the authentication code
4. WHEN the authentication code is used THEN the system SHALL verify the code and complete the email confirmation process with Supabase Auth
5. WHEN the authentication code expires (after 5 minutes) THEN the system SHALL reject the confirmation attempt and require a new confirmation email

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to receive a password reset email when I request it, so that I can securely reset my password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a password reset THEN the system SHALL send a reset email using the Azure email service
2. WHEN the reset email is sent THEN the system SHALL include a secure authentication code that is valid for 5 minutes
3. WHEN the user clicks the reset button in the email THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the password reset page with the authentication code
4. WHEN the authentication code is used for password reset THEN the system SHALL verify the code and allow the user to set a new password through Supabase Auth
5. WHEN the authentication code expires (after 5 minutes) THEN the system SHALL reject the reset attempt and require a new reset email

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the email service to be secure and properly configured, so that email delivery is reliable and authentication codes cannot be compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL securely connect to Azure email service using the EMAIL_SERVICE endpoint, AZURE_KEY, and AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING from environment variables
2. WHEN generating authentication codes THEN the system SHALL create cryptographically secure codes that cannot be easily guessed or brute-forced
3. WHEN storing authentication codes THEN the system SHALL store them securely with expiration timestamps in the database
4. WHEN validating authentication codes THEN the system SHALL check both the code validity and expiration time
5. WHEN an authentication code is used successfully THEN the system SHALL invalidate the code to prevent reuse

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the email service to integrate seamlessly with existing Supabase Auth, so that user authentication flows remain consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes email confirmation THEN the system SHALL update the user's email verification status in Supabase Auth
2. WHEN a user completes password reset THEN the system SHALL use Supabase Auth's password update functionality
3. WHEN the system processes authentication codes THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with existing Supabase Auth user sessions
4. WHEN errors occur during Supabase Auth integration THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the email service is called THEN it SHALL work with the existing Flutter application without breaking current authentication flows

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive properly formatted emails using the existing templates, so that the email experience is consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending confirmation emails THEN the system SHALL use the existing confirm_signup_template.html template
2. WHEN sending password reset emails THEN the system SHALL use the existing reset_password_template.html template
3. WHEN processing email templates THEN the system SHALL properly substitute dynamic content (authentication codes, redirect URLs)
4. WHEN generating redirect URLs THEN the system SHALL include the secure authentication code as a parameter
5. WHEN emails are sent THEN they SHALL maintain the existing visual design and branding from the templates
