# Real Data Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented real data integration using Supabase MCP to replace mock data with actual database records for goalkeepers, fields, and related information.

## Database Analysis Results

### Tables and Data Available:

- **users**: 12 total users (10 goalkeepers, 2 players)
- **fields**: 13 approved fields across Portugal
- **ratings**: Available but currently empty
- **bookings**: Available for future booking functionality
- **availabilities**: Available for goalkeeper scheduling

### Key Database Schema:

- Users table includes goalkeeper-specific fields: `is_goalkeeper`, `price_per_game`, skill ratings (`reflexes`, `positioning`, `distribution`, `communication`)
- Fields table includes location data (`latitude`, `longitude`), surface types, dimensions, and approval status
- Proper relationships between users, bookings, ratings, and fields

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Data Service (`RealDataService`)

**File:** `lib/src/features/map/data/services/real_data_service.dart`

**Features:**

- Retrieves goalkeeper profiles with all attributes
- Supports location-based filtering
- Calculates average ratings from ratings table
- Provides city-based filtering
- Handles booking request creation
- Manages goalkeeper availability queries

**Key Methods:**

- `getApprovedFields()` - Fetches all approved fields
- `getGoalkeepers()` - Retrieves all goalkeeper profiles
- `getGoalkeepersNearLocation()` - Location-based goalkeeper search
- `getGoalkeeperAverageRating()` - Calculates ratings from database
- `getFieldsByCity()` - City-filtered field search
- `createBookingRequest()` - Creates new booking records

### 2. Real Data Models

#### RealGoalkeeper Model

- Handles skill rating calculations

**Key Properties:**

- Basic info: name, city, nationality, club, birth_date
- Pricing: price_per_game with formatted display
- Skills: reflexes, positioning, distribution, communication arrays
- Computed: age, experience level, overall rating, verification status

#### RealField Model

**File:** `lib/src/features/map/data/models/real_field.dart`

**Features:**

- Maps field database records to objects
- Provides location and surface type information
- Handles display formatting for Portuguese terms
- Maintains compatibility with existing MapField structure

### 3. Updated Map View Model

**File:** `lib/src/features/map/presentation/controllers/map_view_model.dart`

**Changes:**

- Integrated RealDataService for data fetching
- Added goalkeeper data loading and filtering
- Updated marker generation to use real goalkeeper data
- Implemented intelligent color coding based on goalkeeper attributes
- Enhanced filtering to include both fields and goalkeepers
- Maintained fallback to sample data if real data unavailable

**Real Data Features:**

- Loads actual goalkeeper profiles from database
- Uses real field locations and attributes
- Applies filters to both fields and goalkeepers
- Generates markers with real data context
- Color codes goalkeepers by rating and status

### 4. Enhanced Map Screen

**File:** `lib/src/features/map/presentation/screens/map_screen.dart`

**Improvements:**

- Updated hire goalkeeper form to display real data
- Added verification badges for verified goalkeepers
- Enhanced goalkeeper details with actual database information
- Improved data presentation with real attributes

## Real Data Features

### Goalkeeper Markers

- **Color Coding**: Based on actual skill ratings and profile completion

  - Gold (FF8F00): Excellent rating (4.5+)
  - Blue (1976D2): Good rating (4.0+)
  - Green (388E3C): Average rating (3.5+)
  - Orange (E65100): Beginner or busy
  - Grey (757575): Incomplete profile

- **Real Information**: Name, location, pricing, experience, ratings
- **Verification Status**: Based on profile completion and data quality
- **Dynamic Status**: Available, busy, in-game, offline

### Field Markers

- **Real Locations**: Actual GPS coordinates from database
- **Surface Types**: Natural, artificial, hybrid grass
- **Dimensions**: Actual field measurements
- **City Information**: Real Portuguese cities

### Hire Goalkeeper Form

- **Real Profiles**: Actual goalkeeper names and information
- **Verified Data**: Shows verification status for credible profiles
- **Pricing**: Real price_per_game values from database
- **Experience**: Calculated from skill ratings and profile data
- **Location**: Actual city and country information

## Data Quality & Verification

### Credible Data Enforcement

- Profile completion requirements for full visibility
- Verification badges for complete profiles
- Price validation and display formatting
- Skill rating calculations from multiple attributes
- Status determination based on profile quality

### Fallback Mechanisms

- Graceful degradation to sample data if database unavailable
- Error handling for network issues
- Default values for missing optional fields
- Consistent data structure regardless of source

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Data Loading

- Parallel loading of fields and goalkeepers
- Filtered queries to reduce data transfer
- Caching through existing repository patterns
- Lazy loading of additional details (ratings, availability)

### Smart Filtering

- Combined field and goalkeeper filtering
- City-based filtering across both data types
- Distance-based filtering with user location
- Real-time filter application

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status updates
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Price range, skill level, availability filters
3. **Booking Integration**: Direct booking through map interface
4. **Rating System**: Display and update goalkeeper ratings
5. **Availability Calendar**: Real-time availability checking
6. **Geospatial Queries**: PostGIS integration for precise location filtering

### Database Optimizations

1. **Indexing**: Add indexes for location-based queries
2. **Views**: Create optimized views for map data
3. **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Pagination**: Add pagination for large datasets

## Testing

### Verification Steps

1. ✅ Database connection and table access
2. ✅ Real goalkeeper data loading (10 goalkeepers found)
3. ✅ Real field data loading (13 fields found)
4. ✅ Data model conversion and display formatting
5. ✅ Map marker generation with real data
6. ✅ Hire goalkeeper form with actual profiles
7. ✅ Filtering and city-based searches

### Test Results
